Final goal: Build a pentesting tool that you can chat and it just runs commands for you.

TO DO:
[ ] Find a way to translate words into commands (I suppose using Llama).
[ ] Find a way to execute those commands.
[ ] Find a way to output useful insights.

Evaluate stack:
[x] Ollama, the easiest way to start
[ ] Llama 3.1? -> LLM optimized for NLP tasks
[ ] Llama 3.2? -> LLM text and images
[ ] LlamaIndex? -> ??
[ ] Evaluate https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb for storing and processing data
