Problem: When we hack into systems, we use hundreds of tools. Almost all of them are command-based, and each tool has its own options and parameters. This makes the process of hacking annoying, as you always have to read the documentation again to remember how to use each tool. This consumes a huge amount of time and energy.

Solution: Hack like you think. We think in our heads using our own words, but we always have to translate what we think into specific terminal commands. That's why I created LlamaHack, a powerful tool that lets you hack like you think. Write what you think, and you will receive back the exact command you're looking for, with all the parameters configured for you. So, you don't have to remember specific flags anymore, making hacking frictionless.
